# european-numerical-methods

An implementation of the LU factorization and Gauss-Seidel methods for solving the system of equations resulting from applying the Crank-Nicholson scheme to the untransformed Black-Scholes equation for European Options.

The implementation is in MATLAB as I was trying to develop my proficiency in the programming language.
